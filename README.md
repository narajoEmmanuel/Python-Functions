# Functionality Practice - Python

This repository contains Python scripts (`menu.py` and `funciones.py`) that demonstrate the implementation of various functions. The user interacts with the script through a menu, selecting different options to test different functionalities.

## File: `menu.py`
### Menu Options:
1. **Leap Year:**
   - Takes a user input year and determines if it's a leap year.

2. **Number Line:**
   - Takes four user input numbers and identifies the number closest to zero.

3. **Bus Fare Increase:**
   - Calculates the new bus fare based on the current fare and a percentage increase.

4. **Body Mass Index (BMI):**
   - Calculates BMI based on user input weight and height.

5. **Multiplication Table:**
   - Displays the multiplication table for a given number.

6. **Multiplication Table Range:**
   - Displays the multiplication tables within a user-defined range.

7. **Cumulative Sum:**
   - Calculates the cumulative sum of numbers up to a given integer.

8. **Triangle Type:**
   - Determines the type of triangle based on the input angles.

9. **Multiplication Check:**
   - Checks if the result of multiplying two numbers is correct.

10. **Student Status:**
    - Determines the academic status of a student based on their average.

### Additional Options:
- **Prime Number Check:**
  - Checks if a given number is prime.

- **Exponential Power:**
  - Computes the exponential power of a number.

### Menu Execution:
- The user is prompted to select an option.
- Based on the option, relevant user inputs are taken.
- The selected function is executed, and results are displayed.

## File: `funciones.py`
### Functions:
- A collection of functions that perform various calculations used in `menu.py`.

### Functions Overview:
- Leap year check, number proximity check, bus fare calculation, BMI calculation, multiplication table generation, cumulative sum calculation, triangle type determination, multiplication check, and student status determination.
